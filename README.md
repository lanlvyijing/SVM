# SVM

recode the python demo in <<machine learning in action>> with c++

ch06  SVM

recode the matrix operation part with eigen3.3(C++ template library for linear algebra),realy speed up the matrix operation time

runtime environmentï¼šwin7-64,vs2013

note:
1.you shold leave enough memory while running this project,otherwise will give a warnning while running
2.Although it is much faster using Eigen, the kernelTrans function will cost most of the running time. Haven't figure out how to fix this problem.
